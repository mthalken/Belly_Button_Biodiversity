# Belly Button Biodiversity

## The purpose of this analysis was to make a interactive tool for individuals who participated in the study as well as anyone looking into the site, so they could see the bacteria cultures found for each individual, wash frequency, and bacteria cultures per sample.

## Project Overview:
1. Create an interactive webpage with a dropdown selection for test subject identification.
2. Desplay the dempgraphics info for the selected ID number.
3. Create a horizontal bar chart with the top 10 bacteria found for the selected ID number using plotly in javascript.
4. Desplay the corisponding wash frequency in a gauge chart for the selected ID number using plotly in javascript.
5. Using plotly in javascript create a bubble chart with the bacteria cultures per sample with the size of the corisponding to the sample size.
6. Using bootstrap and javascript format and edit the page to be more user friendly and apealing.
